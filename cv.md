8. Personal greatest achievement is Lord of The Rings, all three books read in original. Was a rocky way though. Alas, i did it! Was (and continue) playing WoW on english-speaking realms. Never took any language lessons, so speaking english isnt that good, but i can read and understand pretty much everything.
